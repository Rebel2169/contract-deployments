## Contracts Overview

### SmartWallet

The `SmartWallet` contract allows users to deposit and withdraw assets, as well as check their balance. It is designed to provide a secure way to manage digital assets.

### Retainer

The `Retainer` contract manages the relationship between the smart wallet and the assets it retains. It includes functions for asset management and retention logic.
